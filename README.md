There are also 3rd party api's included in this project which will require a secret API key to use to full extent.

## RE-Run
Re-run is the company name I came up with when building this website. The puropose of this website is a local classifields posting website
where users are free to post services and products. This website has similar features to other local classfields websites like: ceate, edit, read and delete
postings, google maps and in app chat feature. The unique feature of this website is a loyalty point system where users are rewarded points from simply using
the website. Users can redeem these points to have their posts featured on the hero banner to increase viewability of postings.
