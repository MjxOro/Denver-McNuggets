# McDonald's x BrainStation Hackathon
This project displays a strategy to improve McDonald’s loyalty program to keep customers onboard and connected with the company. The website replicates the Mcdonald’s app that the UI team designed (mobile responsiveness only) and includes features such as games and a loyalty point system that were built in less than 24 hours.
## Quick Start
